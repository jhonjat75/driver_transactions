# Driver Transactions

link heroku server: https://drivertransactest.herokuapp.com/

This project was to create a sinatra app utilizing the Model View Controller software design pattern.

## The story
In this test you must build a JSON RESTful API, for a small ride-hailing service, that will use the Wompi API (https://docs.wompi.co/docs/en-us/inicio-rapido) for monetary transactions. For starters, you must:
Create an account at https://comercios.wompi.co â€¢ You can use your own personal information Make sure you use the Sandbox environment.

## Cards test
For a transaction with a test card number you should use the following numbers to obtain different responses:

4242 4242 4242 4242 for an approved transaction (APPROVED). Any future expiry date and 3 digit CVC is valid.
4111 1111 1111 1111 for a declined transaction (DECLINED). Any future expiry date and 3 digit CVC is valid.
If you use any other card that is not one of the aforementioned ones, the final state of you transaction will be ERROR.
