This project was to create a Sinatra app utilizing the Model View Controller software design pattern.
## The story

Create an account at https://comercios.wompi.co â€¢ You can use your own personal information Make sure you use the Sandbox environment. That means,

## Cards test
For a transaction with a test card number you should use the following numbers to obtain different responses:

4242 4242 4242 4242 for an approved transaction (APPROVED). Any future expiry date and 3 digit CVC is valid.
4111 1111 1111 1111 for a declined transaction (DECLINED). Any future expiry date and 3 digit CVC is valid.
If you use any other card that is not one of the aforementioned ones, the final state of you transaction will be ERROR.
